DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT :

ðŸ“ˆ Scalable Sales Data Analysis using Dask

This project demonstrates how to perform scalable analysis on a large dataset using Dask, a parallel computing library in Python. It showcases big data processing capabilities and produces statistical insights and visualizations.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

* Dask (for scalable dataframe operations)
* Dask Distributed (for local cluster execution)
* Matplotlib (for plotting insights)
* Pandas & NumPy (for data creation)
* Parquet with Snappy compression (for optimized storage)

ðŸ“Š Features / Analysis Performed

* Generates or loads a large synthetic sales dataset (100,000 rows)
* Calculates basic statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.)
* Identifies top 5 product categories by revenue
* Saves results as a bar chart (`top_categories.png`)
* Stores the processed dataset in Parquet format for future use

ðŸ§  Insights

This script illustrates how Dask can efficiently:

* Handle large datasets using chunked processing (`blocksize='25MB'`)
* Leverage multi-threading or multi-processing for performance
* Perform lazy computations that are only evaluated when needed
* Save data in highly compressed formats for downstream tasks

ðŸš€ Scalability & Performance

This project is a great starting point to understand how distributed computing works in Python. By using Daskâ€™s cluster-based execution model, the script can scale from a single machine to a full cluster without code changes.

Key benefits:

* Memory efficiency: Only chunks of the data are loaded into memory at a time.
* Parallelism: Multiple CPU cores are utilized for faster processing.
* Future-ready: Easily upgradable to cloud-based Dask clusters or integration with Hadoop-like systems.
